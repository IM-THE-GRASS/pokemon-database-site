# Project Title

This is an app that shows a list of most if not all pokemon. This app uses the pokeapi.co API.

# Self hosting
For self hosting this app you need python 3.9, reflex and pokebase. This app does not auto update from the api but you can do it manually by running ```update_pokemon.py```, To run the app you open the ```pokemon-database-site``` directory and run ```python -m reflex run```


tbh this app kinda sucks and id be suprised if you actually used it or self hosted it
